After consultation with the project partner, we decided in favour of vue.js as the frontend/Javascript framework, as they also use Vue in the company. 

**important features and details of Vue.js Framework:**
<br>

- <span style="background-color: #0284c7;">**Lightweight**</span>: Vue.js is relatively lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects, even if you already use other JavaScript libraries or frameworks.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: #0284c7;">**Component-based architecture**</span>: Vue.js makes it possible to split user interfaces into reusable components.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: #0284c7;">**Reactive data binding**</span>: Vue.js provides reactive data binding that allows developers to link data models and user interface components. When data changes, the user interface is automatically updated to reflect these changes.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: #0284c7;">**Directives**</span>: Vue.js has special directives that can be integrated into the HTML markup to control the application of the framework. For example, the `v-for` directive for rendering lists and the `v-if` directive for conditional rendering of elements.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: #0284c7;">**Routing**</span>: Vue Router is an official extension to Vue.js that simplifies the creation of single-page applications with client-side routing functionality.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: #0284c7;">**Tools and ecosystem**</span>: Vue.js has an active and growing community. There are numerous extensions, plugins, and tools that facilitate the development and debugging of Vue.js applications.
