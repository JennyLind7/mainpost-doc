       As postal workers are usually facing the current weather conditions during most of their working day, we consider it an important component to include the current weather conditions in our models in order to make the prediction of downtimes even more accurate.

        OpenWeatherMap is a service that provides real-time weather data and information. It provides access to various weather data, including current weather conditions, forecasts, historical weather data and climate information.

### Integration of weather data in the web application

        <ul>
          <li>
            To retrieve weather data from OpenWeatherMap in our Vue.js application, we used an HTTP client that allows us to send requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and get the corresponding data. In our case, we use the <span style="background-color: fuchsia;"><strong>Axios package</strong></span>, which is a commonly used library for sending HTTP requests in Vue.js applications.
