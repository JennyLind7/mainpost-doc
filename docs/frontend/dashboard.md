The dashboard provides the user with a comprehensive overview of various information and functions. It includes profile information, company details and the status of the user account. To get an initial overview of current figures, "Lieferausfälle je Jahr" and "Verteilung der Verkehrsmittel für Briefe" are loaded on the dashboard in the shape of bar or line charts. Users can choose between the chart types to visualise the data in different ways.

The dashboard also contains a map with data on the "Würzburg" location. The points shown provide a graphical overview of the areas in which employees are absent. A calendar is available right next to it, which contains absences listed for the selected month. The calendar can be edited by the user by manually adding absences for individual employees.
